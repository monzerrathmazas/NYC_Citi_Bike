# NYC_Citi_Bike

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this challenge is to use Pandas to change the "tripduration column from an integer to a datetime datatype. After changing the column from an integer to a datatype, we need to create a set of visualization to show the length of time bikes are checked out for all rider/genders, the number of bike trips for all riders/genders for each hour of the week, and finally show the of bike trips each type of users/genders for each day of the week.
